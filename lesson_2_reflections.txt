What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we initialize a repository a hidden directory .git is created. This contains all the directory structure and files to store metadata of the repository and its history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is an intermediate area; between working directory and repository. 
It acts as a container of files. The user can add files to this area one by one after working on them in the working directory. 
Once user has worked on all related files for a logical change and added them to the staging area he/she can commit them to the git repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Staging area acts as a container of files. The user can add files to this area one by one after working on them in the working directory (git add).
All files related to a logical change can be added to the staging area. After that using command 'git commit' will commit all the files from staging to the repository.
